**Kuka Sales Group** is dedicated to supplying the correct materials testing equipment to our customers at a fair price. We understand the importance of value in performing the test correctly.

Garry Kuka is a Civil Engineer licensed in Idaho and Colorado. After practicing as an engineer for many years, he started the business 25 years ago and has been supplying testing equipment ever since. Joe Kuka graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Saint John’s University and has been back in Colorado since 2014, working his way into the role as President of Kuka Sales Group. The combined experience results in familiarity with the test methods performed by our customers and the equipment required to run them.

It is our responsibility to provide our customers with what they need for testing. We offer the experience and expertise needed to supply the customer with what they want, when they want it, and at a fair price. Value is what we offer our customers.  

We are proud of the company and culture we have built in Kuka Sales Group. Our goal is to supply you, the customer, the correct equipment at the right price, but our commitment is:

> When it comes to testing, if we don’t have it, and we can’t find it, then you don’t need it.
