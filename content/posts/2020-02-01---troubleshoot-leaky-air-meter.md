In the field, many things can go wrong, and it is important whether you are from the Ready Mix plant testing your own concrete or a third party testing firm that your equipment is not what goes wrong. The key word in both quality control and quality assurance is the word QUALITY. 

When your equipment fails to operate properly, it can make you and your company look bad, and few things are more frustrating than dealing with a leaky air pot. It is an easy thing to have happen, and it has happened to everyone. However, there is good news. As easy as it is for your air pot to start leaking, often times it is just as easy to fix the problem. 

In our experience, the large majority of the time that an air meter leaks it is because of the check valve on the air meter pump. To determine this is pretty easy. 

- You first have to remove the pump, usually requiring a ½” box end wrench to break loose.
- Remove the check valve located at the end of the pump
- Use your lips to move air through the check valve in both directions

If the valve is working correctly, **air should only move in one direction.** If air is either not moving through the valve, or is moving freely in both directions, it most likely means that some concrete has become lodged in the valve, either sealing it closed or open. 

- Take the valve and submerge it in a small amount of isopropyl alcohol or vinegar
- Swish it around for a minute or two
- Check the airway again
- Repeat this process 3 - 5 times

If the steps above have been followed and the valve is still operating incorrectly, it's time for a new valve. There is often no need to replace the entire pump which is significantly more expencive than checking the valve for a fraction of the cost.
