Field technicians are notoriously bad at regularly recording minimum and maximum temperatures of their cylinders while they are curing in the field. I think a large amount of this is not the technicians fault, but rather the fault of the equipment.

For a very long time that standard equipment used for this purpose was the mercury “U-Tube” thermometers. I know you all know what I am talking about, the plastic cased tube where the mercury always separated out in shipment so you had to shake it all down to the correct level.  Half of them become so separated in shipment that they are unusable and have to be sent back to the factory. Frankly, they are hard to even get anymore because of laws in different states prohibiting the shipment of mercury, and I believe this is a trend that will continue to spread. If you live in a state that allows the shipment of mercury, enjoy it now, because I don’t think it will last very long. 

Digital min/max thermometers were always available, but always seemed to be too expensive. Luckily for us, technology has advanced, and made these digital min/max thermometers not only more affordable, but easier to use. 

The batteries last longer, and now there are some on the market that use simple AAA batteries, so it is easy to keep them operational. With this advancement, it should be important to equip all field technicians with proper equipment and make it easier to record this required piece of information.

As far as recording the minimum and maximum temperatures, this is the next problem. What good is it to have the equipment necessary to learn this information if it is not recorded immediately? It is important to have a solid system in place to record these temperatures. If you would like it recorded on your data sheet where the other field tests are recorded, you have to make sure whoever goes and picks up the cylinders has that sheet.

One solution that appears to me is to require on that sheet that the pick up technician records the time and location where they picked up the cylinders, as well as who they are. This way they will have to bring that sheet with them, so that they get credit for the time to go pick it up.

Another solution could be on the cylinder log in sheet in the lab. When someone picks up cylinders and brings them to the lab, they have to log in the cylinder, and at this point require the minimum and maximum temperatures be recorded.
