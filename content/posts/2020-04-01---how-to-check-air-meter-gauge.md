As is common knowledge, it is important to have quality equipment in the field.  Almost just as important is your technician’s confidence in their equipment while in the field. When performing an air test, often the site foreman, concrete company, and sometimes even an inspector are watching you run your test, eagerly awaiting to find out if they can lay the concrete. So it is important to make sure all of your equipment is operating correctly before being in that situation.

Luckily, there are a few easy ways to check and make sure it is operating correctly *before* actually running a test. 

- Set the lid on top of your empty air meter base
- Clamp **all 4** clamp assemblies down
- Pump up the air meter to the correct starting percentage
- The air meter should hold air at this point and the dial **should not** be moving
- When you are confident in your results **slowly release** the air bleeder valve cap until you see the dial on your gauge slowly start to return to the left.
- Watch the dial closely

The dial should move smoothly and consistently all the way through its path until it gets to the far left. If any “hitches” can be seen in the movement of the dial the gauge most likely needs to be replaced and at the minimum repaired.

If the dial is catching on something inside the gauge, then it could affect your readings while testing concrete. This is NOT a situation that will remedy itself over time. Rather, it will only get worse.
