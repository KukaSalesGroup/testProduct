Growing up we have all heard the phrase “cleanliness is next to Godliness”. Well, in the testing world, this could not be truer. Obviously it is important to keep everything clean in order to represent you and your company as a technician that knows what they are doing and cares about their work, but there are other benefits to keeping everything clean. The biggest of these is the functionality of your equipment in the field. In addition to affecting the results, dirty equipment has to be replaced more often. 

Below are a few easy tip to help keeping things in order:

### Clean the Slump Plate

A slump plate with concrete dried on it makes it more difficult for the concrete to spread during the test, resulting in a lower slump. A dirty slump plate will change the results of your slump test. If your test is inaccurate the results weill be invalid and the test must be rerun.

### Replace the Tamp Rod

When making cylinders, a dirty tamp rod will contaminate the sample and may cause the cylinder to set improperly, therefore effecting the strength. If your tamp rod is ever in question, it is best to replace it.

### Check the Accuracy of the Air Meters

A dirty air meter will also contaminate the sample, and produce an inaccurate result. If the top of your air meter remains dirty and encrusted with concrete, then all of the attachments will have to be replaced sooner, such as a pet cock getting sealed shut or pump getting clogged.  If a scale gets dirty, then washing it becomes necessary, and everyone knows once you start having to wash electronics with water, the lifespan significantly decreases.
