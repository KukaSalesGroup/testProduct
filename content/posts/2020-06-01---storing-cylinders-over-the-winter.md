Being in beautiful Colorado has its perks for sure, but it also means we can often get surprised by the weather. Last November we had a 24 hr period where we went from 78 deg to 17 deg! With that being said, we can often pour concrete all through the winter on the nice days, which means on the cold days we have to find a way to maintain the proper temperature for our cylinders in the lab. Some people are lucky enough to have full cure rooms with humidity and temperature controlled at all times. Many people do not have this luxury, and so rely on water filled cure tanks.

For those who use cure tanks, it is important that we maintain correct temperature throughout the cure tank and monitor it closely.

### Proper Heater Maintnance

To maintain this heater, make sure the water level in your tank is always above the heating element. Different heaters will have this in different places, and some will even have a mark on them to let you know where the water level should be.

If you do not maintain a high enough water level, the tank heater will burn up and you will need a replacement. Now, obviously we have to leave these heaters running, even when we are not there, and sometimes weird things can happen to cause the heater to break, especially when we are not there.

It is good practice to keep at least one extra heater around, especially during the winter. Second is a well maintained high quality circulation pump. The circulation pump needs to be able to circulate the warm water throughout the entire cure tank continuously to maintain a consistent temperature.

The wall mounted circular recorders are very popular and work very well. There are replacement probes, pens, and papers available for all of these recorders, so with proper maintenance, they should last a very long time.
