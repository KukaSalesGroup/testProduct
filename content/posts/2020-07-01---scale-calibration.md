I know this may seem simple to some, but, get your scales calibrated.. **All of them.** Laboratory technicians rely on the accuracy of their scales and field technicians are no different.

Granted, when you get your certifications, they may not check all of your field scales. However, if there is ever a dispute on a job site over unit weight, and you do not have up to date calibration, you will probably lose the dispute, and money.

It is not worth the stress or cost of being in a situation like that so... **Get your Scales Calibrated!**
