We all know how hard it can be to keep a lab clean. Frankly, just keeping a warehouse clean is hard enough, much less when bucket of soil are being moved in and out. From my experience, you are never going to be able to keep your entire lab clean all of the time. It would be a full time job in itself. However, there are a few spots in the lab that are more important than others to keep clean. Most things in the lab are “dirt proof” meaning that soil won’t hurt them, but then we had to go and introduce electronics into the lab.

Some labs have a couple of scales, some a have a couple dozen. Some have multiple break machines with digital readouts, some don’t have any. These electronics throughout the lab are the items that must remain clean. I know most people don’t like spending thousands of dollars on scales, and many of those purchases could be avoided with proper cleaning. Most scales have pretty good protective covers, but those covers are not supposed to be constantly bombarded with dirt.

I did some work on a universal testing machine recently in a soils lab. This process involved removing a card from inside the computer. Just like all controller cards, these are supposed to be mutli-colored with blue, red, and green terminals throughout. Well, this particular card had become so engrained in dirt, that I could not clean it off enough to see the different colors and had to throw it away, and it was inside the computer casing!

Bottom line: a clean lab will produce more accurate results, save money, and hassle in the long run by extending the life of your electronics.
