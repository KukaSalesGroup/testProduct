This is a simple one that can save technicians a lot of time and grief (and their employers a lot of money). Most people donâ€™t think about this, but at the conclusion of your air test, there is still a vacuum inside the neck of your air meter.

Most people just use the air bleeding system at the top of the meter to release the pressure in the air meter. **Do not do this!**

By releasing the vacuum this way, you allow the vacuum to travel up the neck and into the pump, which will slurp the watery concrete from the top of your pot straight back up into the pump, thus destroying your check valve and maybe the pump itself. 

This can be avoided with these steps:

- Release the air from the pet rocks
- Remove all 4 clamp assemblies
- Tilt the pot and crack the lid allowing the air to escape, thus, removing the vacuum
- Release the remainder of the air from the bleeder cap without anything getting sucked back up into the pump

It is not only simple step to do, but, it will save you from having to replace the check valve or air meter pump itself.
