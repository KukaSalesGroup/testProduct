This post may sound like I am trying to sell something, but that is not the intention. Everyone uses cylinder molds. Most people use more cylinder molds in the summer than in the winter. There are only a few companies that make affordable cylinder molds.

When cylinder molds are being used more quickly than usual, the same is also true for everyone else. This means everyone ends up buying at the same time and from the same basic places. This leads to extended wait times for molds in the summer. Our vendor typically takes 2 weeks to get a pallet to someone over the summer.

I suggest planning ahead. Do not wait until there are only a few cases left before placing an order. I would recommend that not planning on not receiving molds for at lease 2 weeks after placing the order. 

Follow the simple tips above to avoid running out of molds. Just remember, if molds are being used more quickly than usual, chances are, so is everyone else. The manufacturer is trying to keep up with all of it.
